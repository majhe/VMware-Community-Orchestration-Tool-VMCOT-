### 1. STARTING/RUNNING THE APPLICATION: 
In order to start the application (as long as you installed and configured script files according to the instructions above), you'll only need to open a Windows PowerShell session and run the following command on a PowerShell line:
> VMCOTVMwareTool

### 2. GETTING FAMILIAR WITH THE GUI: 
 
Here's the list and use for each one of the available buttons that are present on the main application console. 
 
1. **Connect/Change vCenter Instance:** You will be able to Connect/Disconnect to any of the vCenter instances that are part of the environment. 
1. **Select/Change Cluster:** For choosing Cluster depending on the vCenter Instance that you´re connected too. 
1. **Select/Change Host:** For choosing any of the ESXi Hosts that are part of the Cluster you previously selected. 
1. **Select/Change VM:** For choosing any of the VMs that are running on the selected Cluster/Host. 
1. **Active Alerts:** Display/Export the existing Alerts that are “active” for the selected vCenter Instance. 
1. **Clear Variables:** This will need to be run in order to refresh your session and erase all variables/connections. 
1. **Reports:** Access several reporting options that are available on a per vCenter Instance/Datacenter level. 
1. **SuperAdmin Mode:** Enables SuperAdmin Mode for the selected host. There are a lot of specific tasks that will not be enable unless you enable this feature (keep in mind that enabling SuperAdmin Mode allows you to do configuration changes on the environment. 
1. **Exit:** Closes the application session. 
1. **Cluster Operations:** Enabled if you have a valid Cluster selected, it has access to multiple operations. 
1. **Host Operations:** Enabled if you have a valid Host selected, it has access to multiple operations. 
1. **VM Operations:** Enabled if you have a valid VM selected, it has access to multiple operations. 
1. **Bulk Actions:** Enabled if you have at least 1 host added to the Bulk Operations mode. It has access to multiple options that can be executed in bulk on all the selected hosts (Selected for Bulk Operations). 
1. **Clear:** Clears the Bulk Operations Host selection, so you can start from scratch. 
1. **Add Host:** Adds a new Host to the Bulk Operations Collection. 
1. **Remove Host:** Removes host from the Bulk Operations Collection. 
1. **Maintenance Operations:** Operations that currently do not support Bulk Operations mode, will be executed only on the selected ESXi Host (requires SuperAdmin Mode). 
1. **vSAN:** Access multiple vSAN maintenance options like creating vSAN Disk Groups from CSV file. 
1. **ListBox with all the Hosts that are part of the Bulk Operations Collection**


### 3. HOW DOES THIS TOOL WORK? 
The tool presents different set of operations which are accessible/unlocked as long as you make the appropriate selections, keep in mind that some options are not enabled unless you have certain selection (like Cluster/Cluster/VMs). While some operations are only available once you start adding hosts on to the Bulk Host Collection, some other are not available on this mode and can be accessed through the “maintenance operations” option, which depends on a single host selection and running SuperAdmin Mode. 
This is the summary for this process:

***vCenter Selection > For vCenter operations***

***vCenter Selection > Cluster Selection > For Cluster operations***

***vCenter Selection > Cluster Selection > Host Selection > For Host level operations***

***vCenter Selection > Cluster Selection > Host Selection > VM Selection > For VM level operations***

***vCenter Selection > Cluster Selection > Host Selection > Maintenance operations (No Bulk)***

***vCenter Selection > Cluster Selection > Bulk Operations Mode > Bulk Actions***

### 4. WORKING WITH THE "SUPERADMIN" MODE: 
Certain tasks/options/configurations are not available by default, these aren´t able to be accessed unless the user/administrator explicitly enters “SuperAdmin Mode”. This mode needs to be activated on a PerHost level in order to perform any of the following operations: 

- Accessing Maintenance Operations (No Bulk) for that specific host.
- Adding/Removing/Clearing Host Collection/Selections for Bulk Operations Mode.
- Accessing Bulk Actions/Operations that can be executed in bulk.
- Any other change that implies a possible change of configuration.

### 5. IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS:

- In order to access all the SuperAdmin Advanced Tasks, you need to enable SuperAdmin Mode on your current Host selection.
- If you enable SuperAdmin mode on a specific host, this will only enable all the advanced tasks for that specific host. If you change Host selection, SuperAdmin Mode may not be enable for that host.
- Once you enter SuperAdmin mode, the user will be able to do configuration changes. Be sure of what you´re doing.
- All changes are logged at vCenter level.
- ***PLEASE, MAKE SURE YOU KNOW WHAT YOU´RE DOING.***

### 6. EXPORTING THE OUTPUTS 

Most of the Reports/Outputs that are generated by the Tool are able to be exported to CSV file, the export button is normally accessible on the bottom left corner of these report grids.

### 9. KNOWN ISSUES, BUGS & LIMITATIONS 
- ***Limitations:*** 
  - ***Bulk Removal Operations:*** We aware that VMCOT currently does not have any bulk removal feature/option, so if you happen to write a bad setting while doing bulk operations (like adding 50 vSwitches plus 100 vPortGroups to 16 ESXi hosts), you will then need to manually correct your mistake.
  - ***Adding NTP Server:*** You can only add one NTP server at a time.
  - ***SATP Rules:*** If you need to remove a previously customly created SATP rule, you will need to exactly type all properties to match the SATP Rule you're willing to remove.
  - ***Storage Core Devices Parameter Change:*** While changing parameters on any Storage Core Device (LUN/NMP Device), you will only be able to change the following parameters: maxqueuedepth, schednumreqoutstanding, QueueFullSampleSize, queuefullthreshold. Keep in mind that tool has been developed for dealing with 3PAR Storage and EMULEX Storage Adapters, recommended settings according to HPe/EMULEX/VMware (as of this day) is maxqueuedepth=32, schednumreqoutstanding=32, QueueFullSampleSize=32, queuefullthreshold=4). Configuring QueueDepth & schednumreqoutstanding is adviced. Regarding QueueFullSanokeSize & queuefullthreshold, this is only recommended if you want to enable Queue throttling and have a good reason to enable Adaptive Queue Algorithm. 

- ***Issues:*** 
  - ***Failure to authenticate to Active Directory while Bulk adding ESXi hosts to AD Domain:*** For some reason, sometimes some AD/vCenter environments will force you to type administrator credentials in username@domain.local format, as domain\username is not working in some scenarios. 

- ***Additional Information:***
  - ***UploadVIBFile:*** This option can be used to Upload VIB or ZIP files (bundles).
  - ***InstallVIBFile:*** This will proceed to install a VIB file.
  - ***UpdateVIBFile:*** This will proceed to install/update a .ZIP (bundle) package. Keep in mind that instalation is configured to be ran in "update mode" and will NOT forcefully reinstall any package/VIB that happens to be already installed (same version).
  - ***RemoveVIBFile:*** Removes any VIB package from ESXi instalation. This is very usefull if you want to remove a driver or VIB package from your ESXi server.
